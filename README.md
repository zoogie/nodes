* old-v2.dat and new-v2.dat are database files used by [seedminer](https://github.com/zoogie/seedminer) to improve movable.sed keyy brute force speed. They have been moved from that repo to clean up its commit history.  
* Msed_Update .bat/.py will update your .dat files if placed in the /saves folder in seedminer. Useful for when you're doing automining for bruteforcemovable.com (bfm) and don't wish to stop and restart to update these files.
* graph.py will take both .dat files and produce a strange chart that plots msed data. Only Zoogie understands this data so it's of questionable use to the general public. You need matplotlib installed and I think it only runs in py 2 correctly.
